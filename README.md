------

Configure uWSGI in Emperor mode using Ansible.

[There is no magic rule for setting the number of processes or threads to use. It is very much application and system dependent. Simple math like processes = 2 * cpucores will not be enough. You need to experiment with various setups and be prepared to constantly monitor your apps. uwsgitop could be a great tool to find the best values.](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ThingsToKnow.html)


##n.b.

[If you start uWSGI without threads, the Python GIL will not be enabled, so threads generated by your application will never run...](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html#a-note-on-python-threads) 
see the documentation for more details, but the short version is add the `--enable-threads` option in your vassal config (or enable-threads = true in ini style).
